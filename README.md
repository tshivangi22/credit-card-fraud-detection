The objective of this project was to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting fraudulent credit card transactions with high accuracy, aiming to help financial institutions reduce financial losses and enhance security. The approach involved using the Isolation Forest algorithm, which isolates anomalies through random partitioning, and supplementing it with the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm, which compares the local density of data points to detect significant deviations. Due to the class imbalance in credit card transactions, traditional accuracy metrics were unsuitable, so the model was evaluated using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). The combined approach achieved an AUPRC score of 99.49%, indicating the modelâ€™s effectiveness and robustness in detecting fraudulent transactions and its potential to significantly reduce financial losses due to fraud.
